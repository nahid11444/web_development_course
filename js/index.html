                    Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) was established as part of MIST in the academic session 2000-2001 as CSIT. From a modest beginning, offering undergraduate BSc program to only military students, the dept has now evolved as one of the largest depts at MIST. The dept of CSE now offers BSc programme at the undergraduate level, MSc and MEngg at the post graduate level, as also a doctorate in philosophy PhD.

The dept of CSE boasts of highly qualified faculties, along with state of the art learning infrastructure which provides an ideal platform for students to hone in their skills in the field of computer sciences. The dept provides an ideal environment for the student to specialize in contemporary fields of Computer Science including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Network & Data Security to name a few. The dept also collaborates with both the industry and Govt departments and agencies thereby establishing a symbiotic leadership for both stake holders which is especially beneficial for students.
